Description: Go library for detecting and expanding the user's home directory
 This is a Go library for detecting the user's home directory without the use of
 cgo, so the library can be used in cross-compilation environments.
 .
 Usage is incredibly simple, just call homedir.Dir() to get the home directory
 for a user, and homedir.Expand() to expand the ~ in a path to the home
 directory.
 .
 Why not just use os/user? The built-in os/user package requires cgo on Darwin
 systems. This means that any Go code that uses that package cannot cross
 compile. But 99% of the time the use for os/user is just to retrieve the home
 directory, which we can do for the current user without cgo. This library does
 that, enabling cross-compilation.
